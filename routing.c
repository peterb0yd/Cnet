/*  This is a simple cnet protocol source file which demonstrates the use
    of timer events in cnet.

    The function reboot_node() will first be called for each node.
    reboot_node() informs cnet that the node is interested in the EV_TIMER1
    event and that cnet should call timeouts() each time EV_TIMER1 occurs.
    Finally, reboot_node() requests that EV_TIMER1 occurs in 1000000us (1sec).

    When EV_TIMER1 occurs, cnet will call timeouts(), which will print
    either tick or tock. As each timer event occurs only once, timeouts()
    must finally reschedule EV_TIMER1 to occur again in another 1000000us.
